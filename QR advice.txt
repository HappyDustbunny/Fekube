The recommended QR code minimum size is: 2cm by 2cm, but it's 
better to be safe and go with 4cm+, especially if your QR 
code includes a frame and an embedded logo.

A good rule of thumb is a ratio of scanning distance to QR 
code size of 10:1. For example, if the person scanning the 
QR code will be 10m away, the QR code should be at least 1m by 1m.

The best practice is for the quiet zone to be no smaller than 
the width of 4 "modules" of your QR code pattern (the dot 
pattern if your QR code).

The logos should remain fairly small as if they're too big they 
cover up too much of the scannable part of the QR code.
